        <h3>A nNovel signature Forgery Detection using MATLAB</h3>
        <p>Signature forgery detection is a critical aspect of biometric security systems, where handwritten signatures are used for identity verification. The goal is to differentiate between genuine and forged signatures, ensuring the authenticity of documents.

            In a novel signature forgery detection system using MATLAB, the process generally involves the following steps:
            
            Signature Acquisition:
            
            Signatures are scanned or captured digitally using devices such as signature pads or scanners.
            
            Preprocessing:
            
            The image is preprocessed to remove noise, normalize size, and improve contrast. Techniques such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and edge detection are commonly used in this phase.
            
            Feature Extraction:
            
            Critical features such as geometrical features, pressure, velocity, and stroke dynamics (e.g., speed, direction of writing) are extracted from the signature.

        <h3>School Bus Saftey Enhance System using RFID Cards</h3>
        <p>The School Bus Safety Enhancement System using RFID cards is an innovative solution to improve student safety by monitoring and managing the boarding and deboarding process of students on school buses. By utilizing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, the system ensures better tracking and provides real-time updates to parents, school authorities, and bus drivers.

            Key Components of the System:
            RFID Cards:
            
            Each student is issued a unique RFID card, which contains essential identification information.
            
            The card is linked to the student's profile, including their name, class, and route details.
            
            RFID Reader:
            
            The RFID reader is installed at the entrance/exit of the school bus.
            
            When the student scans their RFID card upon entering or exiting the bus, the reader captures the data from the card and sends it to a central system for processing.
            
            Database System:
            
            A backend database maintains records of students and their RFID cards, as well as their bus schedules.
            
            The database updates in real-time whenever a student scans their card, logging the time and location of the event.
            
            Real-Time Notifications:
